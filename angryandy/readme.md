# Using Cosmovisor

```bash
# download the new version

cd ~/chihuahua
git fetch --tags
git checkout v1.1.1
make install

# check the version - should return v1.1.1
chihuahuad version

# create the upgrade directory if you haven't
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/angryandy/bin

# if you are using cosmovisor you then need to copy this new binary
cp /home/<YOUR_USER>/go/bin/chihuahuad $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/angryandy/bin

# check the version you're about to run is v1.1.1
$DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/angryandy/bin/chihuahuad version
```

# For the (lazy) screen lovers

If you are a lazy screen lover and you are not using cosmovisor

```bash
# download the new version
cd ~/chihuahua
git fetch --tags
git checkout v1.1.1
make install

# check the version - should be v1.1.1
chihuahuad version
```

Wait for the upgrade block height 535000 and wait for your node to gracefully stop, take some time to backup your data directory then start the node again.

# Thank you

A special Thank You to Jacob Gadikian (faddat), Lydia Pierce and Evan Forbes for all the codebase cleaning, version bumps and the 5% commission enforcing code.

Thank you to all the validators who helped testing the upgrade before mainnet! Thank You! Woof!

_The spirit of the wolf shall now be released, and by the way, no, Andy is not angry with any of you!_
